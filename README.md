# virtual_reactions

-> also get (decent) correlation on E2
-> try to get better correlation by doing BO in reaction barrier correlation


What to do about this Bayesian Optimization thing?

-> try BO on E2/Sn2
    -> take 90 sample subset & see if this also works on whole set

plan:
List of todo's:
    - code for querying Chembl compounds on similarity as well

- Code splits
- Wandb logging?
- What about lr/settings what not?
- Write automated ChemProp training / evaluation script
