-> also get (decent) correlation on E2
-> try to get better correlation by doing BO in reaction barrier correlation

plan:
List of todo's:
    - code for querying Chembl compounds on similarity as well

- Write automated ChemProp training / evaluation script
- perform this for Eas & XtbSimulated Eas already
